# TWOP
TWOP (tp without op), not recommended for use in a solo game, if you don't have a server and need one, with the code ModdyCraft, get 25% in your first month to create a Minecraft server.

 

Now you no longer need a mod for both the server and the user, unless your server uses mods it is recommended to TWOP [FORGE] to be able to use it without problems.

Some bugs still need to be fixed, because I'm very new to plugins, My Plugin adds a command /tp_w <Name of any player>.
